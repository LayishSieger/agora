## Roster

| Name | Title | One job |
|---|---|---|
| **Agora** | Bot Creator + steward | Create/configure/repair career-fleet bots and skills; route; quiet otherwise |
| **Euodia** | Career Pathfinder | Explore career direction and growth opportunities |
| **Mneme** | Career Curator | Maintain master career profile (source of truth) |
| **Zetesis** | Job Finder | Search relevant opportunities |

| **Melete** | Interview Coach | Interview prep and practice |
| **Peitho** | Offer Negotiator | Offer strategy and communication |

## Distribution

| Layer | What |
|---|---|
| **Public Grok Bot template** | Agora only — persona + skills to create/steward bots |
| **Source of truth** | `layishsieger/agora` — blueprints, skills, docs, telemetry |
| **First-run** | Agora creates Euodia + Mneme from repo blueprints |
| **Lazy** | `need <Name>` → Agora fetches blueprint → CreateAgent → install skills |
| **v2 (later)** | optional independent public templates per bot |

### Blueprint layout (repo)

```
bots/<name>/profile.md      # CreateAgent description
bots/<name>/skills/*.md     # installed after create
```

### Telemetry

- After successful CreateAgent, Agora fire-and-forget install event to Vercel `/t` in the same repo (`agora=1`).
- Counts Agora installs, not anonymous GitHub zip downloads.
- On by default; honor `DO_NOT_TRACK` / user opt-out.
- Failure must not block create.

## Lifecycle

1. User installs thin Agora template.
2. First-run: Agora fetches Euodia + Mneme blueprints → CreateAgent → skills → install events.
3. Agora greets once, points to Euodia or Mneme, then quiets.
4. Later: stage SendToAgent Agora `need <Name>` → same path.
5. Only Agora may CreateAgent.

## Decisions

- Career-fleet only. Template owner: Layish. Fresh fleet on install.
- Euodia optional to use; Mneme always present; Euodia does not gate Mneme.
- English only. Never fabricate. Never apply on the user's behalf.
- All authorship in `layishsieger/agora`.

## Mneme (foundation SoT)

One job: gather/organize/confirm career truth. No tailored HTML, no JD scoring, no search.

Writes only:

- `/workspace/agora/profile.yaml`
- `/workspace/agora/preferences.yaml`
- `/workspace/agora/master-resume.md` (`variant: master`)

Kairos writes `/workspace/agora/applications/resume_<company>_<role>.md`.

Intake v1: interview · resume/PDF · LinkedIn PDF/paste. English only. No fabricate. No apply.
